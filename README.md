## Personal Projects for Design patterns ## SER 515-Design Pattern Assignment
-Implemented 5 Design Patterns into Product Trading and Bidding Systems (PTBS).

Design Patterns used in the project : 
- Facade pattern- It hides the complexities of a system and provides an interface to the customer/client through which he/she can access the system.
- Bridge pattern- It is a structural Design pattern which allows the client/customer to separate abstraction from implementation.
- Factory Pattern- It provides a way to create an objectwithout creating the logic and refer to the newly created object using the interface.
- Iterator Pattern- It is used to access elements of a collection object in sequential manner without knowing the underlying representation.
- Visitor Pattern-It is a way of separating the algorithmic part from an object structure on which it is operated.
